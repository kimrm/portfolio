            I love coding, and it has been a big part of my life for as long as
            I can remember. Since I was a child I have been fascinated by the
            idea of creating something that others can use. I remember, back in
            the early 90s copying code from computer magazines on to my
            Commodore 64 and the thrill of seeing something happening on the
            screen.

            In my late teens I got into web development with ASP classic
            VBscript on the backend, created databases in MS Access and
            frontends in HTML and CSS. Launched a self-made web shop with a
            friend selling computers and mobile phones and did freelance work
            for a few years , before I started digging into object oriented
            programming with .NET and Visual Basic.

            Got hired by a company that made software for the car dealership
            market. They had developed software that ran on terminals in the
            dealerships and they wanted to modernize it and make a client that
            ran on Windows with a graphical user interface in stead of the 5250
            terminal interfaces. I learned a lot during the 16+ years I worked
            there, but at the same time it made me lose touch with the web
            development world which I loved so much. So in 2019 I decided to go
            back to my roots and started learning web development again, with
            more focus on frontend development. I discovered the joy of working
            with modern Javascript and the possibilities in modern CSS among the
            many frameworks and libraries that had popped up since I last worked
            with web development.

            Now {"I'm"} mostly focused on React and Typescript, utilizing
            frameworks like Nextjs and Remix, but I still do some freelance
            VB.NET development now and then. I also love helping others and
            sharing my knowledge whenever I can.

            {"I'm"} enthusiastic about design and is working on improving my
            design skills every chance I get. My design philosophy is about
            simplicity and following the best practices in UI/UX design. I
            believe that a good design is one that is intuitive and easy to use,
            and that it should be accessible to everyone.

            My motivation for this website is to have a place where I can test
            out new ideas, and also showcase my work and share my thoughts and
            experiences with web development and programming in general. I also
            use this website to build my own library of tips and tricks that I
            can use in the future.
